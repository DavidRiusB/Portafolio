# Portafolio

A collection of mini-projects inspired by coding challenges and technical interviews.

ðŸ¤¯ Mini-Project Showcase ðŸ¤¯
Welcome to my coding playground! ðŸŽ®

This repo is a collection of small-scale React projects that I've built while sharpening my coding skills. Think of it as a digital scrapbook of my coding journey. ðŸ“š

Each project represents a unique challenge I've tackled, from algorithms and data structures to UI/UX design. ðŸ§©

Want to see how I think? Dive into the code, check out the demos (if available), and feel free to leave a star if you like what you see! ðŸŒŸ
